// plaintext
// ciphertext

// Decryption = The process of changing ciphertext into plaintext using a cryptographic algorithm and key
// Encryption The process of changing plaintext into ciphertext using a cryptographic algorithm and key.

// Entity : An individual (person), organization, device, or process; used interchangeably with ‚Äúparty.‚Äù

// Entropy : A  measure  of  the  disorder,  randomness,  or  variability  in  a  closed system; see SP 800 - 90B.

// Key agreement:
//  A  (pair-wise)  key-establishment  procedure  in  which  the  resultant
//  secret keying material is a function of information contributed by both
//  participants  so  that  neither  party  can  predetermine  the  value  of  the
//  secret keying material independently of the contributions of the other
//  party; contrast with key transport.
// Key-agreement primitive: A primitive algorithm used in a key-agreement scheme specified in SP 800-56A3 or SP 800-56B.

// Key derivation:
// 1.  A  process  by  which  one  or  more  keys  are  derived  from  a  shared
// secret and other information during a key-agreement transaction.
// 2. A process that derives new keying material from a key (i.e., a key-
// derivation key) that is currently available.

// Key-derivation key: A key used as an input to a key-derivation method to derive other keys;see SP 800-108.

// Key establishment: A procedure that results in secret keying material that is shared among different parties.
// Key expansion:
// The second step in the key-derivation procedure in which a key-
// derivation key is used to derive secret keying material having the
// desired length(s). The first step in the procedure is randomness
// extraction.

// Key extraction :See Randomness extraction.
// Key-generating module: A cryptographic module in which a given key is generated

// secret key:
// A cryptographic key used with an asymmetric-key (public-key)
// cryptographic  algorithm  that  is  not  made  public  and  is  uniquely
// associated with an entity that is authorized to use it. In an asymmetric-
// key  cryptosystem,  the  private  key  is  associated  with  a  public  key.
// Depending  on  the  algorithm  that  employs  the  private  key,  it  may  be

// used to:
// 1. Compute the corresponding public key;
// 2.  Compute  a  digital  signature  that  may  be  verified  using  the
// corresponding public key;
// 3. Decrypt data that was encrypted using the corresponding public
// key; or
// 4.  Compute  a  key-derivation  key,  which  may  then  be  used  as  an
// input to a key-derivation process.

// public key:
// A cryptographic key used with an asymmetric-key (public-key)
// cryptographic  algorithm  that  may  be  made  public  and  is  associated
// with a private key and an entity that is authorized to use that private
// key. Depending on the algorithm that employs the public key, it may

// be used to:
// 1. Verify  a  digital  signature  that  is  signed  by  the  corresponding

// private key;
// 2. Encrypt data that can be decrypted by the corresponding private
// key; or
// 3. Compute a piece of shared data (i.e., data that is known only by
// two or more specific entities).

// Random Bit Generator (RBG): A  device  or  algorithm  that  outputs  bits  that  are  computationally indistinguishable from bits that are independent and unbiased.

// Randomness extraction : The first step in the two-step key-derivation procedure during which a key-derivation key is produced. The second step in the procedure is key expansion

// Salt: As used in this Recommendation, a byte string (which may be secret or non-secret) that is used as a MAC key
