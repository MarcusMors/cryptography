# Abstract Algebra Math Library

## Algorithms

- cryptography ciphers
- operations (module, inverse, gcd, mcm)
- CSPRNG (chacha20, trivium)
- seed-generators

## How to compile it

at the root of the project.

```bash
cmake -B build
cd build
make
```

## Where are the examples?

every sub library has its own directory in `examples/`
you can try any of the binaries by executing:

```bash
./<sub_library>_examples_<algorithm>
```

where:
- `<sub_library>`: is any of the sub libraries in include.
- `<algorithm>`: is the algorithm or set of them you want to try.

like the following:

```bash
./"operations_examples_inverse"
```
